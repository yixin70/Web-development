My Project for Web Development.

It is a game where you have a missile and your goal is to hit UFOs, similar to space invader but way more simple.

Other than the game, there is a login/register authentication implemented with API REST.
A records system where you can check your own personal records, if logged, or global records (no need to be logged)

For the game, you can set preferences for number of UFOs and time,  both affecting your final score, which can be saved if you are logged
